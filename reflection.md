I attended TA hours on Wed Sep 24 and Thurs Sep 25.
My initial impressions of Java were on how syntactical and difficult it seemed to be. I genuinely feel so lost. That's why this project is nowhere near completion.
Programming definitely seems to have many similarities but it's amazing how frustrating the addition of semicolons and no care about identation can be to someone trying to debug. There was a huge learning curve.
Not many things have worked yet. I need to find a better system as TA hours did not work. Today I attended but they were too busy to get to me so I could not get past tonight's hurdle. :(
